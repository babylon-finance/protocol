<!-- [![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/babylon-finance/protocol/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/babylon-finance/protocol) -->

## Quick Start

Git clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babylon-finance/protocol.git
```

Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Compile contracts

```bash
yarn compile
```

## Development

‚õΩÔ∏è Gas Report

```bash
yarn gas-report
```

üõ° Coverae

```bash
yarn coverage
```

ü§ñ Prettier

```bash
yarn prettier
```

üí™ Solhint

```bash
yarn lint:contracts
```

üìè Contract Size

```bash
yarn estimate-size
```

üß™ Test

To run unit tests

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

To run integartion tests

```bash
yarn test:integration
```

To run fast integration tests (recommended)

```bash
yarn test:integration:fast
```

Or watch test üëÅ

```bash
yarn test:watch
```

## Deploy

To deploy SCs you need to have `.env` file configured for the selected network, e.g., `mainnet`.
The file should have the following entries.

```bash
  ALCHEMY_KEY=XXXXXXXX
  DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=XXXXXXXX
  OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=XXXXXXXX
  BLOCKNATIVE_API_KEY=XXXXXXXX
  ETHERSCAN_KEY=XXXXXXXX
  DEFENDER_API_KEY=XXXXXXXX
  DEFENDER_API_SECRET=XXXXXXXX
```

For non-upgradeable contracts use named scripts from the `deployments/migrations/` folder, e.g., `040-univ2-trade.js`
would deploy `UniswapV2TradeIntegration`. To invoke the script use the following command.

```bash
  npx hardhat deploy --network mainnet --tags UniV2Trade
```

`tags` value can be found inside a deployment script.

To deploy a new implementation for an upgradeable contract use `deploy-contract.js` script, e.g., to deploy a new
implementation for the Strategy contract use the following command:

```bash
  npx hardhat deploy-contract --contract StrategyV16 --network mainnet
```

`contract` is the name of the new implementation.

To auto-deploy a contract use a simple bash script which will try until it succeeds.

```bash
  while ! npx hardhat deploy-contract --contract StrategyV16 --network mainnet; do echo 'Trying to deploy
  again ü§ñ'; done; echo 'Deployed üöÄ';
```

`deploy-contract` command supports passing arguments to the contract constructor. You can use deployments names instead
of the addresses. This feature requires using the `dx{contractName}` notation, e.g.:

```bash
  npx hardhat deploy-contract --contract BabylonViewer --network mainnet dxBabControllerProxy
  npx hardhat deploy-contract --contract AddLiquidityOperation --network mainnet lp dxBabControllerProxy
```

## Upgrade

To upgrade Babylon Protocol use `upgrade-multisig.js` script. It will create a batch tx for Gnosis Multisig to upgrade
all the proxies in the protocol. The command bellow upgrades BabController, RewardsDistributor, Strategy, and Garden to
the appropriate implementations. The implementations have to be deployed beforehand using `deploy-contrat` script.

```bash
  npx hardhat upgrade-multisig --network mainnet --controller BabControllerV11 --distributor RewardsDistributorV11 --strategy StrategyV14 --garden GardenV15
```

All the arguments are optional meaning only required proxies should be upgraded.

The list of options for upgrade is the following:

- controller
- distributor
- garden
- assistant
- strategy
- curve
- oracle
- buy
- liquidity
- deposit
- lend
- tradeCurve
- tradeUniV3
- tradeSynth
- tradeUniV2

An example of the command:

```bash
npx hardhat upgrade-multisig --network mainnet --curve CurveMetaRegistry --oracle PriceOracle --trade-curve CurveTradeIntegration --liquidity AddLiquidityOperation
```

This script will create a proposal at [Defender Admin](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/#/admin). It has to be signed
and executed to upgrade the protocol.

## scripts

### Fuse

```bash
npx hardhat fuse --network mainnet
```

Gets Fuse positions stats of Heart and Heart garden.

### AAVE

```bash
npx hardhat aave 0x371b23eedb1a5e3822aacff906187111a91fae88 --network mainnet
```

Gets Aave positions stats of provided accounts. Many accounts can be provided at
once.
